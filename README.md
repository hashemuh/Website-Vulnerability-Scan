# Vulnerability Scanning for Dararqam.net

## Objective

The vulnerability scan for dararqam.net was conducted on June 9, 2024, using Nikto. The scan identified 6 vulnerabilities across the website, including high, medium, and low severity levels. This report provides an overview of the vulnerabilities found and their potential impact, as well as recommended remediation steps, to improve the security posture of dararqam.net.

### Skills Learned

- Web Vulnerability Scanning: Understanding and performing web vulnerability scanning using Nikto.
- Security Analysis: Analyzing scan results to identify and categorize vulnerabilities by severity.
- SSL/TLS Configuration: Assessing SSL/TLS configurations for common issues and understanding their implications.
- HTTP Header Security: Evaluating and recommending improvements for HTTP security headers.
Remediation Recommendations: Providing actionable recommendations to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
- Report Writing: Documenting findings and conclusions in a structured vulnerability assessment report.
- SSH and SCP Usage: Using SSH and SCP for secure file transfer and remote management.
Cybersecurity Best Practices: Applying best practices in web security to protect against common threats.
- Technical Communication: Effectively communicating technical findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

## Steps
- To start the scan we use the command nikto followed by -h (host) switch to identify the target which is dararqam.net.
We can use the website's IP address.

But it doesn't show much.
- As the domain uses HTTPS, we need to add -ssl flag to scan port 443.

Here we are! Now we can search for these vulnerabilities, assess their severity, and determine how to remediate them.
- This command can save our findings in an HTML file. There are other formats, such as XML and CSV.
